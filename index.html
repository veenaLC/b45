        this is my project FACE DETECTION AND recognition METHOD FOR VIRTUAL examination: </STROng>
        Todayâ€™s pandemic situation it is very difficult to conduct the 
        offline class and examination. So all the institutions adopt the online mode. 
        This research is to develop a prototype of face-based online exam application using an
         approach similar to Eigen face is used for extracting facial features through facial
          vectors and also attendance updating and emotion recognition like Normal, Fear, Tensed
           is implemented using pattern analysis and the datasets are trained using Support 
          Vector Machine<em>(SVM)
